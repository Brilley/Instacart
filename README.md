# Instacart-Kaggle-Competition
Hello,
These are the scripts I have used during Instacart Market Basket Analysis Kaggle competition. User2vec and product2vec scripts are used to create embeddings for users and products using gensim library. Then, Main script is used to generate all the other features and create predictions.
