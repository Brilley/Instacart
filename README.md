# Instacart-Kaggle-Competition

These are the scripts I used during Instacart Market Basket Analysis Kaggle competition. `user2vec.ipynb` and `product2vec.ipynb` scripts are used to create embeddings for users and products using gensim library. Then, `Instacart_Competition_Main_Script.ipynb` run used to generate all the other features and create predictions.
